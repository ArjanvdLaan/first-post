    <td label for="hierarchy">Hierarchy</td>
    <td>The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements, e.a. siblings, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents</td>

    <td>Nesting</td>
    <td>It's terminology for putting element(s) inside other element(s)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Cascading</td>
    <td>CSS has an inherent hierarchy and styles of a higher precedence will overwrite rules of a lower precedence.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Attribute</td>
    <td>An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag. Attributes customize the behavior or appearance of HTML elements. All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value. The name is the property you want to set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Element</td>
    <td>The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value</td>
    <td>The value attribute specifies the value of an input element. The value attribute is used differently for different input types: For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button. For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Division</td>
    <td>The div-tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The div-element is often used as a container for other HTML elements to style them with CSS or to perform certain tasks with JavaScript.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Semantic</td>
    <td>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Selector</td>
    <td>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Declaration</td>
    <td>In CSS, a delcaration is the key-value pair of a CSS property and it's value. Example: text-align:(property name) center;(value)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Specificity</td>
    <td>When we have two or more conflicting CSS declarations on the same element, the browser gives the declarations a score (the specificity) to determine which declaration will be applied to the element. The declaration with the higher score will be applied to the element.</td>

    Metadata: The Brains
The last HTML elements we will explore are involved in metadata processes. You can think of these elements as the “brains” of a webpage because they communicate vital information to the web browser, but are not visible to a webpage visitor. <br>
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: Tells the web browser to expect an HTML document. </li><br>


      <li>&lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;: The root of the HTML document and parent of all other HTML elements on the webpage.</li><br>


      <li>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;: Enclose other metadata about the site, such as its title.</li><br>


      <li>&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;: Contains the site’s title, which is one way users can find your site through a search engine, like Google.</li><br>

      <li>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"/&gt;: Tells the web browser which character set to use. In this case, the character set is “utf-8”.&lt;/p&gt;</li>
      
    </ul>
